Bit shift ::::::::....

16--> 1 0 0 0 0                                                 12--> 1 1 0 0

							        same method but we 
								we give n=3.
shift bit is 1.							it is not a power of two.								
check last to first .						
if we get 0 then move right shift.
if we found 1 then we stop.
after the removing all list significant 0 bits 
then your n=1 . then it is the power of two.
